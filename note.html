1. INTRODUCTION TO HTML(HyperText Markup Language)
    (a.)HTML provides structure to the content appearing on a website, such as images, text, or videos. Right-click on any page on the internet, 
        choose “Inspect,” and you’ll see HTML in a panel of your screen.

    (b.)A markup language is a computer language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text.

    (c.)Compose of several elements
    Ex:
        [---------element----------]
        (opening tag)  (closing tag)
        <p>Hello World!</p>
           (--context--)

    (d.)The Body
    Ex:
    <body>
        <p>What's up, doc?</p>
    </body>
    //Once the file has a body, many different types of content – including text, images, and buttons – can be added to the body.

    (e.)HTML Structure
        -HTML is organized as a collection of family tree relationships. 
        Ex:
        <body>
            <p>This paragraph is a child of the body</p>
        </body>

        <!--the <p> element is nested inside the <body> element. The <p> element is considered a child of the <body> element, 
           and the <body> element is considered the parent.；任何看的到的東西都要放在body裡面-->

    (f.)Headings
    Ex:
    <body>
        <h1>The Brown Bear</h1>
        <h2>About Brown Bears</h2>
        <h3>Species</h3>
        <h3>Features</h3>
        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <h3>Countries with Large Brown Bear Populations</h3>
        <h3>Countries with Small Brown Bear Populations</h3>
        <h2>Media</h2>
            
    </body>
    <!--h1最大-->

    (g.)Divs(division or a container that divides the page into sections.)
    <!-- <div>s can contain any text or other HTML elements, such as links, images, or videos. 
        Remember to always add two spaces of indentation when you nest elements inside of <div>s for better readability. -->
    Ex:
    <body>
        <h1>The Brown Bear</h1>
        <div>
            <h2>About Brown Bears</h2>
            <h3>Species</h3>
            <h3>Features</h3>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Habitat</h2>
            <h3>Countries with Large Brown Bear Populations</h3>
            <h3>Countries with Small Brown Bear Populations</h3>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Media</h2>
        </div>
    </body>

    <!-- SHIFT+TAB整段左移、TAB整段右移-->
    (h.)Attributes
        - Attributes are content added to the opening tag of an element and can be used in several different ways, from providing information to changing styling.
        - 由兩種組成
            - The name of the attribute
            - The value of the attribute
        Ex:
        <div id="intro">
            <h1>Introduction</h1>
        </div>
        <!-- 有點像是幫一個區塊取名子，給他ID -->

    (i.)Displaying Text
        - Paragraph(<p>) contain a block of plain text.
        - <span> contains short pieces of text or other HTML.
          They are used to separate small pieces of context that 
          are on the same line as other context.
        <!-- span 用在單句上面凸顯特定重點；div是用在整體分區 -->
        Ex:
        <div>
            <h1>Technology</h1>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p><span>Self-driving cars</span> are anticipated to replace up to 2 million jobs over the next two decades.</p>
        </div>
    
    (j.)Styling Text
        - The <em> tag will generally render as italic emphasis. (斜體字)
        - The <strong> will generally render as bold emphasis.
    Ex:
    <p><strong>The Nile River</strong> is the 
    <em>longest</em> river in the world, measuring over
    6,850 kilometers long (approximately 4,260 miles).</p>        

    (k.)Line Breaks <br> (分行)
        -The line break element is unique because it is only composed of a starting tag. 
    Ex:
    <p>The Nile River is the longest river <br> in the
    world, measuring over 6,850 <br> kilometers long 
    (approximately 4,260 <br> miles).</p>

    (l.)Unordered Lists
        - In addition to organizing text in paragraph form, you can also display content in an easy-to-read list.
        - In HTML, you can use an unordered list tag (<ul>) to create a list of items in no particular order.
        - Individual list items must be added to the unordered list using the <li> tag. The <li> or list item tag is used to describe an item in a list.
    Ex:
    <ul>
        <li>Limes</li>
        <li>Tortillas</li>
        <li>Chicken</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- output會有一點一點條列式的效果 -->

    (m.)Ordered Lists (<ol>)
        - They are useful when you need to list different steps in a process or rank items for first to last.
        - You can create the ordered list with the <ol> tag and then add individual list items to the list using <li> tags.
    Ex:
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.</li>
        <li>Mix whole wheat flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>Cream the butter, sugar in separate bowl.</li>
        <li>Add eggs and vanilla extract to bowl.</li>
    </ol>
    <!-- 結果會1、2、3、4條列出來 -->

    (n.)Images
        - The <img> tag allows you to add an image to a web page.
        - Most elements require both opening and closing tags, but the <img> tag is a self-closing tag.
        - Note that the end of the <img> tag has a forward slash /.
        - The <img> tag has a required attribute called "src".
        - The value of "src" must be the uniform resource locator (URL) of the image. 
            - A URL is the web address or local address where a file is stored.
    Ex:
    <img src="image-location.jpg" />

    (o.)Image Alts
        - The alt attribute, which means alternative text, brings meaning to the images on our sites. 
            - 有三個用處:
                1.如果圖片故障，還能讓人了解圖片的大意
                2.讓視障朋友也能了解圖片的意義
                3.讓搜尋引擎可以搜尋

    Ex:<img src="#" alt="A field of yellow sunflowers" />

    (p.)Videos
        -  the <video> element requires an opening and a closing tag.
    Ex:
    <video src="myVideo.mp4" width="320" height="240" controls>
            Video not supported
    </video>

        - After the src attribute, the width and height attributes are used to set the size of the video displayed in the browser. 
          The controls attribute instructs the browser to include basic video controls: pause, play and skip.
        - The text, “Video not supported”, between the opening and closing video tags will only be displayed if the browser is unable
          to load the video.


2.HTML DOCUMENT STANDARDS
(a.)Preparing for HTML
    - You can let web browsers know that you are using HTML by starting your document with a document type declaration.
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    - This declaration is an instruction, and it must be the first line of code in your HTML document.
    - It tells the browser what type of document to expect, along with what version of HTML is being used in the document.

(b.)The <html> tag
    -To create HTML structure and content, we must add opening and closing <html> tags after declaring <!DOCTYPE html>:
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>

        </html>
    <!-- 在html中的程式碼才會被正確以html的規格來執行 -->

(c.)The Head
    - let’s also give the browser some information about the page itself. We can do this by adding a <head> element.
    Ex:
    <head>
    </head>
